<p>The <span class="arabic-term">Idafa (الإضافة)</span> is one of the most fundamental and common grammatical structures in Arabic. Mastering it is a huge step towards sounding more natural and understanding complex sentences. In English, we call it the "possessive" or "genitive" construction. It's how you say things like "the door of the house" or "the student's book."</p>
<h2>The Two Parts of Idafa</h2>
<p>An Idafa construction consists of two (or more) nouns placed next to each other. The first noun is called the <span class="arabic-term">مضاف (muḍāf)</span>, and the second is the <span class="arabic-term">مضاف إليه (muḍāf ilayhi)</span>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Muḍāf (المضاف):</strong> The first noun, the thing that is "possessed."</li>
    <li><strong>The Muḍāf Ilayhi (المضاف إليه):</strong> The second noun, the "possessor."</li>
</ul>
<div class="example-box">
    <p class="arabic-example">بابُ البيتِ</p>
    <p class="translation">(bābu l-bayti)</p>
    <p class="translation">The door of the house</p>
</div>
<p>In this example, "door" (باب) is the Muḍāf, and "the house" (البيت) is the Muḍāf Ilayhi.</p>
<h2>The Three Rules of Idafa</h2>
<p>To form a correct Idafa, you just need to remember three simple rules that apply to the <strong>first noun (the Muḍāf)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>It can NEVER have the definite article 'al-' (ال).</strong> It's always indefinite in form, but definite in meaning if the second noun is definite.</li>
    <li><strong>It can NEVER have tanween (ـٌ, ـٍ, ـً).</strong> It takes only a single vowel at the end.</li>
    <li><strong>If it's a plural or dual, it drops its final 'n' (ن).</strong> For example, <span class="arabic-term">معلمون</span> (teachers) becomes <span class="arabic-term">معلمو</span> in an Idafa.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>second noun (the Muḍāf Ilayhi)</strong> has only one rule: it must always be in the genitive case (مجرور), which usually means it ends in <em>kasra</em> (ِ) or <em>kasratain</em> (ٍ).</p>
<h2>More Examples</h2>
<div class="example-box">
    <p class="arabic-example">كتابُ طالبٍ</p>
    <p class="translation">(kitābu ṭālibin)</p>
    <p class="translation">A student's book (the book of a student)</p>
</div>
<div class="example-box">
    <p class="arabic-example">مفتاحُ السيارةِ</p>
    <p class="translation">(miftāḥu s-sayyārati)</p>
    <p class="translation">The key of the car</p>
</div>
<div class="example-box">
    <p class="arabic-example">مُديرُ الشركةِ</p>
    <p class="translation">(mudīru sh-sharikati)</p>
    <p class="translation">The manager of the company</p>
</div>
<p>Once you start recognizing the Idafa pattern, you'll see it everywhere in Arabic. Practicing it will dramatically improve your ability to read and form more complex and elegant sentences.</p>
