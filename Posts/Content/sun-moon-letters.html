<p>One of the first pronunciation rules you'll encounter in Arabic is the curious case of the definite article 'al-' (ال). Sometimes the 'l' sound is pronounced clearly, and other times it disappears, causing the next letter to be doubled. This is all determined by whether the letter following 'al-' is a "sun letter" or a "moon letter."</p>
<h2>What are Moon Letters (الحروف القمرية)?</h2>
<p>Moon letters are the "easy" ones. When the definite article 'al-' comes before a moon letter, the 'l' (ل) is pronounced clearly and distinctly. The name comes from the word for "the moon," <span class="arabic-term">القمر (al-qamar)</span>, where you can clearly hear the 'l' sound.</p>
<p>There are 14 moon letters.</p>
<h2>What are Sun Letters (الحروف الشمسية)?</h2>
<p>Sun letters are the "tricky" ones. When 'al-' comes before a sun letter, the 'l' sound is NOT pronounced. Instead, it assimilates into the sun letter, which is then stressed or doubled (indicated by a <em>shadda</em> ّ symbol in writing). The name comes from the word for "the sun," <span class="arabic-term">الشمس (ash-shams)</span>, where the 'l' is silent and the 'sh' sound is doubled.</p>
<p>There are also 14 sun letters.</p>

<h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
<p>Mastering this rule is crucial for correct pronunciation and will make your spoken Arabic sound much more natural and fluent. It's one of the key indicators that separates a beginner from an intermediate speaker. While it might seem like a lot to memorize, you'll find that with listening and speaking practice, it will become second nature.</p>
